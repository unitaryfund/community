# 2021 Unitary Fund Community Roadmap

## Check out our current community roadmap [tasks as issues](https://github.com/unitaryfund/community-roadmap/issues) ##

All of our community planning is done here in the issues of this repo, you can see the tasks layed out kanban style on the [project board](https://github.com/unitaryfund/community-roadmap/projects/1).
Basically, when community has a new fun idea to idea that they want either UF or the community directly to do:
- It should get recorded on this repo as a backlog issue,
- The UF team will triage it and add some suggested tasks/prioritization,
- We will discuss it at community calls and invite members to take ownership of tasks they want to help out with.

**Please feel free to add feedback at any point, or assign yourself to an issue if you want to help out!**
