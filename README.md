## We are currently working on these tasks on the [project board](https://github.com/unitaryfund/community-roadmap/projects/1).

Want to help grow the quantum open source community? Check out what we are working on by looking at the [issues](https://github.com/unitaryfund/community-roadmap/issues) on this repo. Leave a comment if you are interested in contributing!

## Have a new idea for us to work on?
- Make a [new issue](https://github.com/unitaryfund/community-roadmap/issues/new/choose),
- The UF team will triage it and add some suggested tasks/prioritization,
- We will discuss it at community calls on our [Discord](http://discord.unitary.fund) and invite members to take ownership of tasks they want to help out with.

**Please feel free to add feedback at any point, or ask to be assigned to an issue if you want to help out!**
