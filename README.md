> ## Want to help grow the quantum open source community? Check out what we are working on by looking at the [issues](https://github.com/unitaryfund/community-roadmap/issues) on this repo. Leave a comment if you are interested in contributing!

All of our community planning is done in the issues of this repo, you can see the tasks layed out kanban style on the [project board](https://github.com/unitaryfund/community-roadmap/projects/1).

Basically, when community has a new fun idea to idea that they want either UF or the community directly to do:
- Make a [new issue](https://github.com/unitaryfund/community-roadmap/issues/new/choose),
- The UF team will triage it and add some suggested tasks/prioritization,
- We will discuss it at community calls and invite members to take ownership of tasks they want to help out with.

**Please feel free to add feedback at any point, or ask to be assigned to an issue if you want to help out!**
